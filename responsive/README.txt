For Responsive Lab

Devices and Resolution:
I set my page to load "Dice" if the resolution was less than or equal to 640px
wide. I tested it using the iPhone 5. My page loads "No Dice" for higher 
resolution displays. I tested it using my Macbook (1280 x 800).

Everything has been correctly implemented.

Hours spent: 1 hour

Help Received:
I viewed the source code for the example page and I read about media queries
on Firefox MDN.
