    <h2 class="shadow">About Me</h2>
    
    <p>
        My name is AJ Jenkins and I'm a junior at Tufts University. My majors
        are Computer Science and Cognitive &amp; Brain Science. I'm currently
        doing HCI research with Prof. Rob Jacob in the CS department. We're
        looking at using brain signals as a form of passive input for computing
        applications. I work in the Center for Cognitive Studies for Daniel
        Dennett and Ray Jackendoff. I've also been an RA (resident assistant)
        for the past 2 years. My hobbies include video games, movies, and
        sailing.
